7.  Enter Room 2
        Do same as in Room 1


// Running in fight COULD always reset player to Room 1.

// It would be cool to track which room we are in and automatically
// enter the appropriate room.
    // We could implement a boolean in class Room, that does that for us.
    // If boolean "active" == true -> Player is currently in this room.
    // If boolean "active" == false -> Player is not in this room.
    // Entering and exiting a room would then be setting active to
    // true or false.
    // We could then use a while loop (player.hp > 0) to loop through
    // the list of all rooms and always enter, present and fight in
    // the room where active == true.

// How do we switch rooms? How will Main know, which room to set as active 
// next? 
// We could implement a variable "RoomInDirectionIsRoomNoX" that we could 
// return into main when exiting the room. (enum NextRoom)
// We could then simple use an if statement that checks agains that variable
// and then does the "LoadRoomX", "AllRooms.Add(RoomX)" and "EnterRoomX"
// functions.
// What should that variable look like? Could be a string. Could be an enum.
// We would have to also check, if room is already loaded/instantiated.

// We could also, instead use a 2-dimensional array, and map each room to a 
// position in the array. Each point in the array would then be a single room. 

// Why is LoadRoomX a static? 
    Because, we want a new room each time.
    We could instead use a non static function and create one room in main,
    which we then modify by calling LoadRoomX. Butthat would result in the
    same room getting overwritten. 
    But we might need to reenter a room we already have been to.
    All the Changes would be lost then.
