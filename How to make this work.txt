Running from a fight will always reset player to Room 0.

// It would be cool to track which room we are in and automatically
// enter the appropriate room.
    // We could implement a boolean in class Room, that does that for us.
    // If boolean "active" == true -> Player is currently in this room.
    // If boolean "active" == false -> Player is not in this room.
    // Entering and exiting a room would then be setting active to
    // true or false.
    // We could then use a while loop (player.hp > 0) to loop through
    // the list of all rooms and always enter, present and fight in
    // the room where active == true.

// How do we switch rooms? How will Main know, which room to set as active 
// next? 
// AllRooms stores all the Rooms. 
// We can then use a simple if statement that checks agains "Room.Active"
// and then does the "AllRooms[x].EnterRoom()" function.

// Why is LoadRoomX a static? 
    Because, we want a new room each time.
    We could instead use a non static function and create one room in main,
    which we then modify by calling LoadRoomX. Butthat would result in the
    same room getting overwritten. 
    But we might need to reenter a room we already have been to.
    All the Changes would be lost then.

// Rooms need to have a list of enums "RoomBoundaries" and save wall-types
// inside of that list. List<WallType>[0] ≙ North, List<WallType>[1] ≙ East etc.
    // How do we track, which door is in this room? 
    // In specific: How do we check inside a room if we need a special key for
    // this specific door?
        // class Door? 
        // Each door:   bool locked = true or false;
                        string key = "nameOfKey";
